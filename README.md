# stock-management
This is a simple system that can track the stock levels in a warehouse.
The warehouse is a produce warehouse that deals in various items of produce. 
All day long cases of produce flow into and out of the warehouse, so there is a simple system to keep track of the current stock levels for each of the products stored in the warehouse.
The menu will allow the user to select a produce variety from the list of varieties the warehouse stocks. Selecting an item from this menu will automatically update the current stock display that appears next to the menu.
The bottom part of the interface allows the user to enter information about items entering and exiting the warehouse. 
To add a particular item to the inventory, the user will select the item from the menu, enter a number of cases in the text field, and click the button labeled "In". 
To ship cases out from the warehouse, the user will click the button labeled "Out". 
Clicking either of these two buttons should cause the stock level display to update.
